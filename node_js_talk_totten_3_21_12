iisnode - handles scale out across multiple cores in windows
most modules handled as is

a few modules that are written in native c++ (and compiled for Linux) won't work
performance on windows is similar to linux

IIS Node provides:

min. changes to node.js app. code

You can do web socket connections outside of IIS
