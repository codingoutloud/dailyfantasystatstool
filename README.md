# README for dailyfantasystatstool
Eventually this will be an interactive tool to help with picking players to use for daily fantasy sports lineups on web sites
such as FanDuel, DraftStreet, DailyJoust etc. Right now, it is barely more than demo code.

It is primarily a JavaScript application, using Sencha Ext JS 4.x and their MVC framework.
The server side, for now, is written in nodejs, and is currently deployed to Azure at azure-nodejs.cloudapp.net.
