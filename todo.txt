An earlier versio of this is running at http://azure-nodejs.cloudapp.net!

Next steps:
x Clean up directory - remove modules, non-used files
x get app to run with loader, remove classes.js
x Add extjs directories
x Create dummy stats data, stats record, stats store, grid for stats
x Move dummy data to middle pane and remove feed list from middle
x Change left pane from Feeds to Filters and add a dummy filter
x Move css into css file
x Change theme
x Change namespace from FV to DFST
x Change dummy data to baseball data
x Add rest of relevant baseball stats to model (based on fanduel scoring), 
x then grid, then dummy data
x Create drill down panel
x Add panel to layout
x Add select logic to open up drilldown panel
x In drill down panel add details for player info.
x Add store for player stats
x Add date to filter players for game day
x Format date in player grid

Filter players by date: (server side)
Create server side end point to generate player stats, randomly
For pitcher detail only show pitcher stats columns
For hitter detail, only show hitter stats columns?
Fix bug on drill down panel - can't expand after collapse

Change theme colors
Fix css to remove references to feed, etc.
remove references to articlegrid, feedshow
Add copyrights to all files
Figure out 1 typical interaction to code and then define tasks to get this in with dummy data

Change server.js implementation to be cleaner - use some modules, but not sure which
Figure out build process for Ext JS 4


Fanduel baseball scoring:
Hitters: 1B = 1pt, 2B = 2pts, 3B = 3pts, HR = 4pts, RBI = 1pt, R = 1pt, BB = 1pt, SB = 2pts,
HBP = 1, Out (calculated as at bats - hits) = -.25pt
Pitchers: W = 5pts, ER = -1pt, SO = 1pt, IP = 1pt*
