Next steps:
=========
check in code from c9!!
Save off quartz POC to github and blog it
use quartz to schedule all daily scripts
- pull list of scripts from blob storage
- then pull scripts from blob storage
- use a blob lease to prevent concurrent access
- run all daily jobs/load_lineups
move working code back into the WEBAPI solution
research git post commit hooks to move perl scripts directly from git to azure blob
Get a domain name
Move from temp. account to own azure-insiders account
WordPress!
fantasyfeud might be easy to load data for: http://www.fantasyfeud.com/#draftkit.salaries

Misc.
==========
Find weather data
Add who's hot option; do some daily computation and put in db
should put a help bar icon on the toolbar in the filters with a popup to expain the section
uncheck games that have already occurred in the day, so not chooseable
need to check out project to new area -to make sure I can do everything I need to
export top grid to csv
create state manager for grids
more logging
why doesn't sitedetailsstore make ajax call when filtered()?
Can't pick a player that has no stats yet, since they don't show up
need to figure out how to deal with sites where player can play multiple positions (for position filters)

UI:
==========
add time of update for starting lineup
get rest of stats to fill in buzz draft scoring
add teams filters
add column with position played in bottom grid?
Add model for scoring to save in db?
need glossary or tooltips for column headers
need player filters - use generic grid filters?
Change theme colors
Clean up header for bottom grid - full team name, full mlb position name, other?
need reset filters button
need filter summary (or summaries?)

NodeJS:
===========
use express?

ExtJS:
===========
Figure out build process for Ext JS 4
On stores, encodeFilters, encodeSorters are all copy-paste: Either create a
common proxy for them to all use or fix the server side to accept the default
  sort and filter format generated by EXTJS (latter is preferable?)

Loader/Data:
===========
lineups for doubleheaders? 5/28/2012
add backup to lineups script to look for other games from another site?
complete buzzdraft scraper/scoring? or is it even worth it?
probably need to double check probable pitchers filter for dailyjoust
recheck all stats against an external source - particularly games played and appearances for pitchers
Clean up logging - don't exit on errors, just log and continue, use a logging api?
schedule the db update scripts to run regularly
create script to roll up player data?
buzz draft: need a couple more stats for pitcher, need to figure out how to post and not get flagged for CSRF
capuano showing as started on 5/9?
tim hudson 5/23 - didn't pitch?
2 Chris Carpenters - BOS player is in minors. - How to tell difference in data loader scripts, need fanduel teamid mapping table
David Winfree: eliasId = 456406 (minor league player - can ignore for now)

Maintenance:
===========
add copyrights to all files
combine webapi and load projects into one github repo?
need backup strategy for Azure db.
