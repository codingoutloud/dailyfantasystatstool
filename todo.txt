Next steps:
x Clean up directory - remove modules, non-used files
x get app to run with loader, remove classes.js
x Add extjs directories
x Create dummy stats data, stats record, stats store, grid for stats
x Move dummy data to middle pane and remove feed list from middle
x Change left pane from Feeds to Filters and add a dummy filter
x Move css into css file
x Change theme
x Change namespace from FV to DFST
x Change dummy data to baseball data
x Add rest of relevant baseball stats to model (based on fanduel scoring), 
x then grid, then dummy data
x Create drill down panel
x Add panel to layout
x Add select logic to open up drilldown panel
x In drill down panel add details for player info.
x Add store for player stats
x Add date to filter players for game day
x Format date in player grid
x Add more data
x Hide details panel until player selected
x Fix bug on drill down panel - can't expand after collapse
x Fix css to remove references to feed, etc.
x move references to articlegrid, feedshow
x find data source - done mlb gameday api via updated Baseball Hacks scripts writing data to SQL Azure
x choose web api technology - done .net web api
x create initial web apis for teams/players
x try to hit web apis from cloud9 page (via localhost) - enable CORS support on Web API
x run upload scripts to get more data from mlb
x fill in more data for main grid
x change properties of single, double, triple to not have a leading digit
x Add paging to players grid - simple paging done, always gets all from db, but pages in controller layer
x Add server side sorting (OR client side paging and let extjs do sorting)
x Change all stats to include totals and not averages
x fix runs stats - not there???
x add games played to grid
x move afp calculation to server
x create script to clean out duplicate games
x get rest of available stats from web service
x get real data
x save data in sql azure
x innings pitched as whole number or .1 or .2 (1 out, 2 out)
x create web api for individual players/game data
x get hit by pitch stat
x double check batting stats in mlb load scripts
x get schedule data
x add sorting to per game grid
x add filter by game date
x why does .filter() add the same filter value from stats controller and filters controller? - bug in filter code, worked around it
x capitalize team names
x create team and player tables
x get team lists and roster data!!!
x create upload script for players
x add player position!
x need option to hide all but probable pitchers
x add filters for all positions?
x rebuild db from scratch :-(
x make sure update script properly puts in the teamID for the roster (nymets is wrong!)
x change scoring to be selectable
x Add interface for scoring
x apply selectable scoring to pergameplayerstats; player stats getting retrieved 3 times - fix!!
x Document how load scripts work - in About.txt of load project
x change schedule update to load from yesterday to 5 days from now... don't need rest of season
x db: remove gameinfo from game table, remove gameinfo column
x db load scripts: Need to move connection strings to an external file
x Get scripts to work with mysql again, so CAN check in those connection strings...
x position DH?? - hacked a solution by grabbing all players from rosters that are not listed in players and adding them to players
x need all/none link for position filters
x fix wins header
x add columns for pitcher averages (strike outs, earned runs, walks, innings pitched)
x add opponent column
x double check scoring for fanduel -diffs: jose altuve (I have him with 20 games(4.0), fd with 17 (3.7))
  - It is definitely wrong. The bottom grid does have 19 games and looks correct - db had duplicate rows for 4-24-2012
x Change UI to show team code, not team id
x deploy web service to azure
x Fix server.js bug that doesn't send out correct content-type header (doesn't work on safari/mac) - switched to using node-static
x accidentally double loaded some data... check for duplicate dates...
x may not have loaded data for 5/5 or 5/6 - double check those dates
x start saving off daily pricing data from fanduel - manual process every day, right now
x add client-side paging to game grid (bottom one), 5 per page?
x need to double check the update script, the dates don't seem to be correct - fixed bug
x add icon for injured players
x filter out players with no price - they must not be available to choose from on site
x upgrade to extjs 4.1 
x add filter for injured players
x add commented out columns back, just as hidden
x add sliding filter for prices
x add sliding filter for cost per point
x add sliding filter for avg pts & # games
x fix loading icon on grid - extjs 4.1 bug

Next.
==========
add timing info - performance is starting to lag
Find out if I can legally check the db scripts in...
check in db scripts to github?
add version information to ui

Misc.
==========
add games list somewhere on page
create state manager for grids
more logging

UI:
==========
add probable pitcher icon to pitchers
Position filters - should vary by site ex. for fanduel - should have outfield, instead of LF, CF, RF, so need to catch event on radio button to set checkboxes
get rest of stats to fill in draft day scoring, buzz draft scoring
scrolling broken on top grid
add teams filters
add column with fd position played in top grid?
add column with position played in bottom grid?
Add scoring column(s) dynamically
Add model for scoring to save in db?
need glossary or tooltips for column headers
add scoring for other sites besides FanDuel
need player filters - use generic grid filters?
Change theme colors
use Ext.ux.grid.FiltersFeatureView for grid filters??

NodeJS:
===========
use express?

ExtJS:
===========
Figure out build process for Ext JS 4
On stores, encodeFilters, encodeSorters are all copy-paste: Either create a
common proxy for them to all use or fix the server side to accept the default
  sort and filter format generated by EXTJS (latter is preferable)

Loader/Data:
===========
check fanduel pricing - how often does it change... can I hit same url for updates every day - NO
recheck all stats against an external source - particularly games played and appearances for pitchers
double check pitching stats in mlb load scripts - might be more stats we're interested in
double check fielding stats in mlb load scripts? - don't need to yet
Clean up logging - don't exit on errors, just log and continue
schedule the db update scripts to run regularly
create script to roll up player data?

Maintenance:
===========
add copyrights to all files
Need to check in Web API solution
Need to check in loader scripts
